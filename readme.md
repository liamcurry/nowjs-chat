A simple project I'm using as a way to get familiar with Node,
socket.io, Travis CI, etc.

A lot of the dependencies used and structure of my code has been based
off the work and best practices of others. Here are a few projects where I
found inspiration:

* [Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express)
* [Mozilla Open Badges](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges)
* [Calipso](https://github.com/cliftonc/calipso)
* [Screenshot App](https://github.com/visionmedia/screenshot-app)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
